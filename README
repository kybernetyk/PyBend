PyBend
------
Simply put: use begin/end instead of mandatory indents in your Python code.

Based* on pybraces (http://timhatch.com/projects/pybraces/) by Tim Hatch.

* and by based I mean 1:1 rip off with begin/end instead of curly braces as { } are used to define dictionaries in Python which leads to collisions.

Installation
------------
Put braces.py in your python encodings folder. Insert following line into files where you want to use begin/end:

# -*- encoding: braces -*-

Example
-------
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- encoding: braces -*-

if True:
begin
  print("Hello World");
        print "lol";
a =   ["a", "v"];
    print a
end

WTF?!

Yes, I'm serious. I'm seriously fucked off by Python's whitespace Nazism. I hate those "let's put that code into a loop ... OH FUCKING WHITE SPACES" situations.
